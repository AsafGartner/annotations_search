    "2:01:33": "highergravity Q: Long time archive viewer, but first time live streamer! I have two pre-stream questions but I can never make the pre-stream time. 1) Do you have a strong opinion about why int *p is \"superior style\" than int* p, or are you impartial to whatever the developer prefers?"
    "2:02:12": "Demo: Pointer declaration style"
    "2:04:40": "highergravity Q: 2) Do compiler optimisations (-O2) guarantee that the same output is generated for time-independent code? That is, does the out-of-order processing ever introduce some nasty logic / contol flow bugs that -Od wouldn't?"
    "2:08:01": "mtsmox Q: You said you didn't want to use PRETTY_FUNCTION because that wouldn't work because of duplicate GUIDs. But the only place where PRETTY_FUNCTION would have been used is in TIMED_FUNCTION, which should never be used more then once in any function anyway. So not using DEBUG_NAME in TIMED_FUNCTION would solve the problem. All the other calls to TIMED_BLOCK_ would still work with DEBUG_NAME and thus use the COUNTER to be unique. So I think the extra field for the Name is really not necessary."

    "2:09:43": "linike860 Q: What is your opinion on Minkowski Portal Refinement for collision detection and response? I feel it is much nicer as it gives you much of the collision information (normal, depth, etc.) without having to implement an entire separate algorithm like GJK does"

I just found your series and was amazed that you are creating an entire game without using an external library like SDL (from what your episode one said, at least).

Can you suggest any specific usages to pursue for either program robustness, optimization, etc.?"

What would probably be easier and more graphic for larvas to grasp is to make a little functional game(title screen, game loop, game over, start over, etc) and THEN iterate upon it.

Seems like you went to a lot of trouble to remove the transient arena from the OpenGL renderer so things can't be pushed from there"
    "35:43": "thesizik Q: What PDF reader is that?"
    "35:57": "elxenoaizd Q: Why is it in C++ that people always like and do many compilation units, one for each .cpp file? Is it just because it's how visual studio build works?"
    "37:14": "cubercaleb Q: Won't Anti-Viruses get finicky with you writing to the end of an exe? Doesn't that also break code signing?"
    "38:15": "cubercaleb Q: Is it practical to roll your own C runtime? From what I have gathered there seems to be a lot of problems with that sort of thing. Of course M$ has the audacity to ship incompatible versions of the CRT on different versions of Windows. Any workarounds for this?"
    "38:55": "boondoggle42 Q: Have you considered guest programmers for the interim?"
    "39:31": "That's it for tonight"

    "29:54": "Mr4thDimention Q: I'm working on a sort of experimental alternative to modes that reduces (probably eliminates) key holding! Do you still think that's a part of the problem for you?"
    "30:46": "ingenero Q: Could these streams be a good time for some C++ tutorials or something similar?"
    "31:22": "CaptainKraft Q: How much of the renderer that you wrote for Handmade Hero will be replaced when you move fully into OpenGL?"

    "32:59": "markarcioulo Q: I've been doing some reading on early computer graphics technology, 60s and 70s. Any thoughts on the topic?"
    "33:40": "CaptainKraft Q: You've mentioned before that there are great programmers that have very different skillsets. What skillset is your strongest? Did you actively try to get better at it or just naturally fall into that skillset?"
    "35:23": "thesizik Q: Dolphin is the emulator, not the chip"
    "36:27": "ChronalDragon	Q: lol I like how every part of the GameCube is being labelled \"Dolphin\" by Casey now"
    "36:37": "elxenoaizd Q: Thanks for the great answer! Regarding my question about rotation and scaling, apologies but I wasn't able to find the time to research it in Handmade Hero code due to my full-time job. The question was: How do scale and rotation play nice together if rotation is stored at the first 3x3 part of the transform matrix and the scale is at 1,2,3 diagonal? Wouldn't they step on each other's toes?"
    "37:32": "ambiguous_panda Q: Ever have to write accessibility features for people with disabilities like RSI?"
    "37:55": "boondoggle42 Q: Since Jon Blow is soliciting for programmers to contrubute to JAI, would you be interested in being involved in any way?"
    "38:11": "symbolic_butt Q: What do you think about model-view-controller pattern? If you already ranted about this, feel free to ignore this question"
    "38:35": "sssmcgrath Q: (specific to me so feel free to skip): Remember that grid visibility determination thing? I spent 2 minutes thinking about it, I think just 4 8-bit numbers indicating how far in each cardinal direction you can see from that cell... solves everything! 4 bytes per cell. ez pz."
    "39:04": "ileacristian Q: In the first videos (archive) you mention that you won't use anything like OpenGL. Did you change your mind on the way?"

    "43:57": "elxenoaizd Q: So one of the main problems is not that we're not fast enough but probably not accurate enough in emulation. But if the docs were pretty clear about everything related to the hardware, the specs, etc. where they really go down in details explaining how everything works, wouldn't that make the life of emulation authors easier?"
    "45:04": "beefog Q: Now that I am playing The Witness, would you explain again what part you worked on?"
    "46:07": "longboolean Q: I'm thinking of getting a sewing machine pedal for mode switching in vim"
    "46:31": "acalc Q: Any suggestions on the ideal computer chair (and settings) for programming? I tend to have problems with the backs of my legs. (For a while now, I've actually been using one of those rubber exercise balls as a chair, which works but isn't the most comfortable thing ever, I guess)"
    "47:51": "symbolic_butt Q: Do you know other advanced algebra topics that became a thing in modern programming like quaternions did?"

    "52:46": "elxenoaizd Q: I'm very sad to hear about your hands, Sensei. I pray and wish you get well soon"
    "53:08": "ciryus33 Q: Around Day 130 or so you said that OpenGL and Direct3D were out back waiting to be put down and that everyone would be using Vulkan. Based on your comment just now, do you no longer feel that way?"
    "55:09": "mmv94 Q: Have you heard about the Godot Engine? Do you think it is a good tool for a prototype / proof of concept?"
    "55:22": "ileacristian Q: How do you and Jonathan Blow know each other?"
    "55:28": "elxenoaizd Q: Any general tips / suggestions how to approach the code for a new project with little to no art done for it yet? We have almost a complete game design document listing all the code stuff we need but there's so much stuff it's tricky to figure out where and how to start"
    "55:59": "Miblo Q: Are you familiar with nonograms? effect0r introduced me to them recently and I'm now addicted"
    "56:11": "longboolean Q: You're probably the wrong person to ask, but do you have any idea when / if The Witness will get a Linux version?"
    "58:08": "elxenoaizd Q: Have you ever tried building something for mobile and submitting it to a store? Like, Apple store, it's quite the tedious process, takes 30 minutes to build and only when it finishes it tells you if there was any errors.... it's quite the nightmare for me I don't understand why there are so many mobile game developers"
    "58:51": "boondoggle42 Q: If doctors could grow you clone arms on the back of a host animal, say, a pig, would you accept them as transplants onto your body to get another 30 years of pain free programming?"
    "59:14": "ratchetfreak Q: Would it be possible to make a front-end wrapping the next-gen graphics APIs that you like?"
    "59:37": "sssmcgrath Q: When my platform / game library is more ready would you be interested in scrutinizing the API design? (I mean look before it's too late to change it, but when it's something I think isn't awful)"
    "1:00:45": "sophira Q: Are there any wrappers around OpenGL / D3D / Vulkan that you would prefer to become a full 3D API rather than just a wrapper?"
    "1:01:01": "symbolic_butt Q: BTW, do you know what happened with The Witness' sound? A bunch of people I know had issues (including myself) and had to disable surround sound or something"
    "1:02:26": "powerc9k Q: Have you completed The Witness?"
    "1:03:16": "Miblo Q: Something I find kind of interesting regarding the financial viability of Linux is that, in those Humble Bundle payment pie charts, the Linux segment tends to be way above 1%"
    "1:07:35": "thesizik Q: Could you stream The Witness?"
    "1:07:58": "longboolean Q: Let's change the name, call it SteamOS: now is it viable?"
    "1:09:35": "Wrap that up"
